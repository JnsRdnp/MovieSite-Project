# MovieSite

The project was created by second-year students of Oulu University of Applied Sciences for the Web Programming Application Project course. The goal of the project was to develop a comprehensive full-stack application for movie enthusiasts. The client-side was implemented using React, and the server-side with Node. The Moviesite application allows users to explore information related to movies, read related news, create their own accounts and groups, and rate movies. The application utilizes APIs from IMDb and Finnkino. At the end of the project, the application will be released for use using the Render service.

## Technology and tools
The database was created using PostgreSQL, and Postman and Visual Studio Code were used as development environments. The project's backend was implemented with Node, and the frontend with React. GitHub was utilized as the version control tool, where the application code is available. GitHub was also used for Kanban project planning.

## Deployment

1. Clone the repository to a folder your choice
2. Make sure you have Node.js installed
3. Open the terminal and type "npm i" in the server directory
4. Do the same for the client directory
5. Type "npm start" in the client directory terminal
6. Type "node app.js" in the server directory terminal
7. After this the application should be running on localhost:3000

## How the app works

From the homepage of our website (image 1), you can find popular movies, new reviews, and movie-related news. The movies on display change regularly, accompanied by background images related to the films. You can see the five latest reviews directly on the homepage, and if needed, you can find more reviews on the "Reviews" page. At the bottom of the page, you can access news sourced through Finnkino.
